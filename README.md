# Python List Operations Assignment

## Description
This assignment demonstrates basic Python list operations, including creating lists, adding elements, inserting items at specific positions, extending lists with new elements, removing items, sorting, and finding the index of a particular element.

## Topics Covered

* List creation
* Adding elements (`append`)
* Inserting elements (`insert`)
* Extending lists (`extend`)
* Removing elements (`pop`)
* Sorting lists (`sort`)
* Finding element indexes (`index`)

---

## Program Details

The program executes the following steps in sequence:

1. **Create** an empty list called `my_list`.
2. **Append** the elements `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to `my_list`.
3. **Insert** the value `15` at the second position in the list.
4. **Extend** the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. **Remove** the last element from the list.
6. **Sort** the list in ascending order.
7. **Find** and print the index of the value `30`.

## Example Output
When you run the program, you should see output similar to:

```

Created empty list my_list: []

Appended elements 10, 20, 30, 40 in my_list: [10, 20, 30, 40]

Inserted the value 15 at the second position in my_list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]

Extended my_list with the list [50, 60, 70]: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]

Removed last element 70 from my_list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

my_list sorted in ascending order: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

The index of the value 30 in my_list is 3

```

##  How to Run
1. Save the Python code in a file named `list_operations.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the file's directory.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python list_operations.py
    ```
